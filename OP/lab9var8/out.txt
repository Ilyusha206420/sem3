What this life if, full of care,
We no time to stand and stare.

No to stand beneath the boughs
And as long as sheep or cows.

No to see, when woods we pass,
Where hide their nuts in grass.

No to see, in broad daylight,
Streams of stars, like skies at night.

No to turn at Beauty’s glance,
And her feet, how they can dance.

No to wait till her mouth can
Enrich smile her eyes began.

A life this if, full of care,
We no time to stand and stare.
